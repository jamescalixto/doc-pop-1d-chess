    " # Build lookup tables for sliding rook-like and bishop-like attacks\n",
    " \n",
    " ## We can precalculate sliding attacks\n",
    "Some pieces can perform sliding moves. They can move (and capture) until they hit another piece, traversing every squares (for rooks) or every other square (for bishops) or both (for queens). This is a little intensive to calculate at runtime. We can save time by precalculating and caching these in a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is a 20-bit integer, with the first 4 bits representing the location of the sliding piece and the remaining 16 bits representing occupancy. We can use any slow algorithm we wish to calculate the set of possible moves for the sliding piece, and finally we return a 16-bit integer representing that set. \n",
    "\n",
    "## It's not as much space as you'd think\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to do this for every permutation of location, occupancy, and move type. This seems like a lot but upon calculation, it is very feasible:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given `n` pieces on the board, the number of possible occupancies is at most ${16 \\choose n}$, as there are 16 spots on the board and we are choosing `n` of them to put pieces on. (The real number is smaller, because there are occupancies that may be unreachable in a real game, but it's almost impossible to figure that out ahead of time.) For each occupancy, there are `n` possible locations for the sliding piece, and two move types to precalculate (rook-like and bishop-like). Thus we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2n * {16 \\choose n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "permutations, given `n` pieces. We now need to sum over all possible values of `n`. The lower bound of `n` is 3 (two kings and a sliding piece) and the upper bound of `n` is 12 (the number of starting pieces). So we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{n=3}^{12} 2n * {16 \\choose n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "total permutations to look at, which comes out to `1029632`. So for a mapping of a measly ~1M 20-bit keys to two 16-bit values each, we can look up sliding piece attacks almost instantly with only bitwise operations. That's only ~6.7 MB of data — not bad! \n",
    "\n",
    "## A clarifying example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example to clarify. Let us consider the black queen on square 6 in the following position:\n",
    "\n",
    "`♔..♘.♕....♜♞...♚`\n",
    "\n",
    "The location, square 6, can be represented in binary as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`0110`\n",
    "\n",
    "and the occupancy of the board can be represented in binary as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`1001010000110001`\n",
    "\n",
    "so, putting these together, the input is the 20-bit integer:\n",
    "\n",
    "`01101001010000110001`\n",
    "\n",
    "which, incidentally, corresponds to `431153` in decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider the rook-like attack first. `x` represents attackable spaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "`♔..xx♕xxxxx♞...♚`\n",
    "\n",
    "which corresponds to the moveset:\n",
    "\n",
    "`0001101111100000`\n",
    "\n",
    "equivalent to the decimal number `7136`. Similarly for the bishop-like attack we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "`♔..x.♕.x.x♜x...♚`\n",
    "\n",
    "which corresponds to the moveset:\n",
    "\n",
    "`0001000101010000`\n",
    "\n",
    "equivalent to the decimal number `4432`. We can OR them to get the total moveset for the queen:\n",
    "\n",
    "`0001101111110000`\n",
    "\n",
    "equivalent to the decimal number `7152`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we store the mapping `431153 -> (7136, 4432)` (we can generate the queen mapping by ORing the rook and bishop mappings) then we can efficiently lookup movesets for any sliding piece in any position.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But it says it attacks its own color piece! That is wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that the occupancy does not take into account color — this algorithm (correctly) indicates that the black queen can capture the white rook and white knight and also (incorrectly) indicates that it can take the black knight as well. This is intentional — it is easily fixed in a subsequent step by ANDing the moveset with the complement of the black occupancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Black occupancy is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`1001010000000000`\n",
    "\n",
    "and its complement (indicating all non-black squares, comprising white squares and empty squares) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`0110101111111111`\n",
    "\n",
    "and the AND of that in the total moveset `0001101111110000 & 0110101111111111` gets us:\n",
    "\n",
    "`0000101111110000`\n",
    "\n",
    "which is what we expect from the original position, repeated here:\n",
    "\n",
